# CRH Open Medical Certifications & Licenses Dataset

Welcome to the first open-source dataset by **Clinical Records Hub (CRH)** — a curated list of healthcare-related certifications, licenses, and recognized qualifications relevant across African and global medical practice.

This dataset was created to support electronic medical record (EMR) systems, clinical credentialing workflows, digital verification tools, and AI/ML research into healthcare professional qualifications.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset includes:

- National medical and dental council licenses
- Nursing and midwifery board registrations
- Pharmacy council and pharmaceutical licenses (including BPharm)
- Medical laboratory science council credentials
- Allied health, radiography, physiotherapy, and other domain-specific licenses
- Pan-African qualifications and specializations
- Certifications from international boards (where applicable)
- Excludes veterinary and device regulation licenses (for now)

> This dataset is not exhaustive but is continuously expanding. Contributions are welcome.
